# Dwarf_Fortress_Simulation
A Simulation game developed in conjunction with the professor Ricardo Tachiquin <a href=https://github.com/rtachiquing> (@rtachiquing) </a> , I added some new features to the game like a  Social net that matches the characters depending of some factors like:
- Social Status
- Job Type
- Gender
- Character type

Those factors determine the type of friendship that 2 characters can have, for example:
- Loving Friendship
- Support Friendship
- Close Friendship
- Casual Friendship
- Team-workers

All frienships are represented by a graph, where each node represents a character and each edge represents the type of friendship between two characters:

Another new feature added to the game was that now the user is able to create groups of characters for different purposes, maybe for research, for protection or exploration.

In the Groups Menu you can find the created groups and the options to go back or create a new group:

All these features were implemented with Python and Data Structures Like Heaps, Stacks, Queues and Hashmaps, if you want to know more about the project click in the following Link: https://github.com/Nirok2823/Dwarf_Fortress_Simulation/tree/master
